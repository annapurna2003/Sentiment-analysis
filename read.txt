Animal proves to be a colossal disappointment that leaves audiences questioning the sanity of its creators lots of critics are giving paid five star or four star reviews do not believe them this movie is nothing but a sob begging for the attention from his billionaire father such plot is stretched for almost four hours got no idea which person wrote such a story and ranbir agreed to do such a film when his career is already sinking Director Sandeep Vanga known for his previous work in Kabir Singh fails to replicate his earlier success instead delivering a convoluted storyline that lacks direction and purpose Vanga has a thing with misogyny and films objectifying women in kabir singh shahid is slapping kiara and in animal ranbir is glorifying infidellity by claiming its right in the name of his father what could go more pathetic than this
After watching the trailer I was excited and eagerly waiting for Animal I was disappointed after watching the film couldn’t live up to the expectations it created with its trailer Animal is an illogical and misogynistic film with solid performance by Ranbir Kapoor starting from the dialogue to the scenes the film shows no respect towards women Women are beaten up and treated as mere sexual objects Ranbir Kapoor, usually a charismatic and versatile performer, struggles to salvage the film with his portrayal of a conflicted character. His efforts are hampered by a poorly developed script that fails to establish a connection between the audience and the characters
Animal is an unfortunately devolves into a hodgepodge of clichés and inconsistencies The screenplay riddled with melodramatic dialogues and predictable twists lacks the subtlety and nuance required for a film of this nature Rashmika and Anil kapoor were just okish Animal is a cinematic misstep that not only fails to showcase the talents of its celebrated cast but also highlights the pitfalls of a poorly executed script and direction
got no idea why people and critics are giving fake and paid reviews for small amount of money offered by producer of this film feeling sad for them Save yourself from this cinematic catastrophe, and choose to invest your time in a more deserving piece of storytelling
think this movie could have been done in 2hr 40 minutes or something like that. Some scenes in second half didn't made any sense , he had sex with Zoya so that he can know what the enemies are planning, c'mon you said in the beginning you are Sigma male
