# Sentiment-analysis

<h1>NLP is the analysis of words and not sentences</h1>

<h2>A few questions you might have while reading the code</h2>

<h3>Why are we using utf-8 while reading the file?</h3>
<h4>utf-8 is used in reading files as while we copy text from any site or blog, the text copied could be encoded, using utf-8 while reading the text file helps in reading the proper file without encoded value. ( basically, decrypts and the encrypted file so we can read the plain text)</h4>

<h3>*Why should we change all the letters or characters in the text file to lowercase?</h3>
<h4>Movie != movie [Case sensivity] So we convert all the cases to lower case to have better insight about the sentiments in it</h4>

<h3>What does tokenization mean?</h3>
<h4>Tokenization - breaking the sentence into words. saves each word in a list</h4>

<h3>What are stop words?</h3>
<h4>Stop words are the words that add no meaning to the sentence and hence can be ignored from the list while we make tokenization of the file</h4>
